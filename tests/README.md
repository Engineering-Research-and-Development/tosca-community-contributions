<p>Statement of Purpose for this OASIS TC Open Repository (tosca-community-contributions) as <a href="https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/tosca/201608/msg00005.html">proposed</a> and <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/58670/TOSCA-TC-Minutes2016-08-04.docx">approved</a> [<a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/TCADMIN-2420">bis</a>] by the TC:</p>

<p>The repository manages TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML templates and definitions that can be used to test TOSCA tools and orchestrator compliance. The intent is for each item to contain metadata using the OASIS Test Assertion Markup Language (although other metadata may also be permitted) that describes the test and the expected behavior of the tool or orchestrator under test. The TOSCA TC has directed the TOSCA Interoperability SC to consider contributions in this repo as a potential basis for the establishment of a test assertion work product.</p>
