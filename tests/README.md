<p>This directory contains TOSCA service templates that can be used to test TOSCA tools and orchestrator compliance. The intent is for each item to contain metadata using the OASIS Test Assertion Markup Language (although other metadata may also be permitted) that describes the test and the expected behavior of the tool or orchestrator under test. </p>
