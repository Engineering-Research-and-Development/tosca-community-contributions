  This TOSCA definitions document contains the TOSCA Simple Profile
  node types as defined in the TOSCA Simple Profile for YAML v1.1
  specification.

node_types:

  tosca.nodes.Root:
    description: >
      This is the default (root) TOSCA Node Type that all other TOSCA
      nodes should extends.  This allows all TOSCA nodes to have a
      consistent set of features for modeling and management (e.g,
      consistent definitions for requirements, capabilities, and
      lifecycle interfaces).
    attributes:
      tosca_id:
        type: string
        description: >-
          A unique identifier of the realized instance of a Node
          Template that derives from any TOSCA normative type.
      tosca_name:
        type: string
        description: >
          This attribute reflects the name of the Node Template as
          defined in the TOSCA service template.  This name is not
          unique to the realized instance model of corresponding
          deployed application as each template in the model can
          result in one or more instances (e.g., scaled) when
          orchestrated to a provider environment.
